# Implementation of Conway's Game of Life with UI.

I have implemented this single player game during this lockdown sadly as I was dying to go outside.

If you don't know what game of life is and you are less than 20 then you are a just a kid you won't get what life is about(PS- It gets tougher as you get old!!). Or you can just go to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) Wikipedia link and also can check out the patterns mentioned there.

I have also made the UI which will first ask you to fill these:

![First Screen](https://github.com/PraphulJain/game_of_life/tree/master/imgs/1.png)

Then you can fill the your input grid which I have made through JCheckBox:

![Second Screen](https://github.com/PraphulJain/game_of_life/tree/master/imgs/2_1.png)

Here I have basically given an infinitely growing input and then just click on submit and watch as the magic happens.

You can try your own patterns or try out the patterns from wikipedia. Or wyou can obviously improve it.

# Thanks for reading enjoy!!
